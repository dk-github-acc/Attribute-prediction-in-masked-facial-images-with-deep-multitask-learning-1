## INTRO
**[Technical Report(link)]** **[ARXIV]**

We create a masked face dataset by efficiently overlaying masks of different shape, size and textures to effectively model variability generated by wearing mask. This paper presents a deep Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approach to jointly estimate various heterogeneous attributes from a single masked facial image. Experimental results on benchmark face attribute UTKFace dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach supersedes in performance to other competing techniques. The paper was selected for PReMI2021 conference.
